<p>In this Compose file, an IPvlan L3 network called <code>motioneye_net</code> is created with a subnet of <code>192.168.0.0/24</code>. The MotionEyeOS container is configured to use this network and is assigned an IP address of <code>192.168.0.2</code>.</p>
<p>To access the MotionEyeOS web interface, you can connect to <code>http://192.168.0.2:8765</code> in your web browser. The MotionEyeOS container will be able to access the video device at <code>/dev/video0</code> as long as it is mapped into the container as a volume.</p>
